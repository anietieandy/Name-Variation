This conversation I'm having with Angie about the Grammys&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ðŸ˜‚
Turned on the Grammys just as Mumford came on #daymade
#grammys2013 teasing me with prospect of Bob Marley tribute when I want to watch Downton Abbey
I promise I will be singing along to the Bob Marley tribute, also promise it will be better than anything was before Mumford &amp; Sons #Grammys
Glad I'm not seeing any one direction or Justin bieber on the #Grammys
Johnny Depp! #Grammys
Watching the Grammy awards with @traceludewig, @dperry71, and Johnathan (@ Codee's Pad w/ 2 others) http://t.co/1pzOrzk1

Comprobado: Adele gana cada vez mÃ¡s Grammos que Grammy's... :P
@llcoolj #grammy if I tweet the most can I Meet LL and BeyoncÃ¨??? I'm working on it!!
Is it possible to go back thru the time machine Johnny Depp emerged from and go back to when the Grammys were good and relevant?
&amp; Chris	Rhi &amp; Chris. At the Grammys happier than ever. Not giving even a inch of a fuck about what people have to say.
Wish Michael Jackson was at the #grammys tonight, doin his thing
Watchin the #grammys OMG Rihanna's Dress Is So Pretty
"@edsheeran: that nigga taylor swift rigged the grammys bc i said her dress made her camel toe pop"
Beyonce making money. She just performed at the Superbowl, now the Grammy's.
Great performance by Mumford...ordering tix for St Augustine show NOW!  #Grammys
Mumford and Sons were awesome!!#grammys
Can't wait for the Bob Marley tribute, it's the only thing worth watching the #GRAMMYS for

Mumford and Sons killing it at the #grammys.
Mumford and Sons keep the music industry from being the despise of the country. Along with a few others. #GRAMMYs

Grammy's on hold...time for some Walking Dead!! If Daryl does...things will break
Carrie's so pretty #Grammys
Ed Sheeran is the best performer at the Grammys. He can perform by himself without editing the sound. Not to mention he writes all his songs
â€œ@UrielSuriel: Ahora que lo pienso, no he visto a Christina Aguilera en los Grammy, Â¿Se habrÃ¡ daÃ±ado la grÃºa que la iba a llevar?â€
"@ChrisetteM: I'm pretty sure Johnny Depp is my celebrity crush. #Grammys"
Carrie underwood wears the prettiest dresses! #GRAMMYs #whataninspiration
â€œ@NYC_Blonde: Jay-Z's "you're welcome" for the win #Grammysâ€
Off camera at the Grammys: LL Cool J quits hosting and Mumford &amp; Sons takes over and just keeps performing.
"	I don't know much about music but "We Are Young" was definitely song of the year, they got it right #Grammys
Commercial is more exciting than Grammy, Charlie? ðŸ¾ðŸ¶ðŸ‘€ http://t.co/dqv4PGTT
@jackgoesforth @JayCocks Did Stephen Fucking Foster win a Grammy? #CampTownRaces #1037grammys
Feel bad for whoâ€™s sitting behind Solange Knowles @ #Grammys - need stadium seating to see over that hair. Also, she should be performing.
Hey Grammy's I've got two words for you: Vanilla Ice! I'm tired of watching these amateurs. Bring back the Ice! #bushleague
Mumford and Sons, always fantastic. #Grammys
Drake or Nas, ehhh you both deserved it those are the two I wanted to win, more Nas because he's deserves his first Grammy more.
Still pulling for a surprise Grammy appearance by Bruce....
Adele is still trying to figure out how to get the wrapper off of her Grammy bar. #grammys

@1Dsexylads Ikr..."We Are Young" by Fun won the grammy 4 the song of the year...I saw his face he was really excited to win :'(
"@99JAMZWEDR: Alright! We're an hour in on the Grammy's, what did you or didn't you like so far!?" Rihanna shoulda won an award by now
If I have to see Taylor swifts ugly ass face all night... #Grammys
Ahhhhh Johnny Depp. #grammys
Johnny Depp was one of the first I wanted to follow on Twitter but realized its so obv that JD would never tweet I know him so well #grammys
These #grammys performances are as bad as watching paint dry. I hope JT pulls a Janet at the Super Bowl.
crying â€œ@DevGnarley: If Drake wins a Grammy tonight... Us light skin dudes are leading at the half #Saluteâ€
Not a big Timberlake fan hopefully it's not the new suit and tie song... #terrible #grammys

I feel bad @carrieunderwood is sitting one person away from Chris Brown. I sure wouldn't want to be within arm's length of him. #grammy2013
So ready to see @jtimberlake performs at the Grammy's coming up!!!
@TheGRAMMYs @rihanna @BrunoMars Where do we vote not to have Rihanna in the mix?
@BravoAndy #Grammys not boing. I am playing find John Mayer in the crowd game. Love him!
I'm ready for Justin Timberlake to perform! #GRAMMYS
Loved seeing Johnny Depp! Best actor ever!!! #GRAMMYs
Cant wait for Justin Timberlake to hit the stage. ANYTIME he collabs with Timnaland on any project, its magic. #Grammys
JT has really blossomed from his former days of wearing all denim with Brittney to the Suit and Tie era. #ComeToMommy #Grammys
â€œ@easyweezie: List of people I want to shit themselves at the #Grammys : Beiber, T. Swift, Rihanna, Chris Brown, LL COOL Jâ€ omg! Funny!
At The Kit Kat Club watching the Grammys with my manfriend and his friends and one of the Chicago Mob Wives.
Why was Johnny Depp dressed like a lazy Steven Tyler? #GRAMMYS
Mumford and sons are gods, they're so original and sounded awesome as usual â˜º #lovethem #Grammys
Mumford and sons will always make me happy #Grammys2013

The worst song to start the Grammys/: ew. Damn Taylor.
@TheGRAMMYs BRING ON JUSTIN, STING, BRUNO MARS AND PRINCE!!!!
In case there was any confusion, that WAS Mumford, not Sublime. I was excited, thought Bradley Nowell cleaned up and got fat. #Grammys
Mumford and Sons and The Black Keys are the only reason I'm watching the Grammys.
Lmaoooâ€œ@MikeEpps___: I wonder why every time Chris Brown reach to scratch that back of his head Rhianna Jump #Grammysâ€
Ready for Justin Timberlake! He's the  best #Grammys
@TheGRAMMYs : Bring out Justin Bieber already !
Taylor you are never ever ever allowed back to the #Grammys after that little stunt
It looks like T Swift is trying to get with the different man bands by the way she's getting excited every time one sings on stage #grammys
&amp; Rihanna	#grammys Chris brown &amp; Rihanna so I take it there back together I bet they have been together I bet they never broke up
RT @Funny5ive: Trinidad James selling DVDs of seasons of Martin outside the grammys
So where's Luke Bryan, George Strait, and Jason Aldean? The ones that actually deserve Grammys..
â€œ@getglue: Taylor should have put that much energy into her own performance #GRAMMYs #GetGlue http://t.co/PpRZXKmhâ€ right #Grammys2013
RT â€œ@sinbadbad: So far the best Grammy moment was LL cool J on dick Clarkâ€™s american bandstandâ€ #Grammys
TS is wearing shoes during her performance ha! #Grammy2013
Mumford is the only good part about the Grammy's this year swear I didn't blink once during that performance
@BreeTheWanted I kinda knew it with the Grammys. I mean this IS the 2nd or 3rd time they snubbed Bieber.
Mumford and Sons has now given me hope that I can one day have a favorite band when DMB stops touring. #GrammyAwards #Grammys2013
â€œ@HipHopWired: Drake's expression to J.Lo's dress. Classic. #GRAMMY http://t.co/6JA9XFurâ€

Only Tyler the creator would throw duck face and peace sign on the Grammys.
When I was a kid I thought the Grammy's were awards for grandmas. This erroroneous thought was solidified when Steven Tyler won in 1995.
That frank Ocean dude looks like a mini Kevin Durant #Grammys

Nope, she's not a spokeswoman for Craftsmen but Kelly Clarkson is certainly ratchet as hail. #Grammys
Also I think she is still drunk from Endymionâ€¦bc what was that? #Grammys
Rihanna is on fire @TheGRAMMYs
Rihanna is about to KILL the stage #mygirl #grammys
Been listening to @Kelly_Clarkson throughout thesis writing &amp; reminiscing about her Jones Beach concert. So fabulous #Stronger #Grammys

Adam Levine is pure hotness, too! Mmmm! #GRAMMYs
"Stay where you are, Rihanna takes the Grammy stage, next!" Actually, no, I'm gonna GTFO right now. #Grammys
Also? I miss the Johnny Depp from the original 21JumpStreet. Before he became the 21st century Michael Jackson. #grammys
Just remembered when Alicia Keys wore cornrows...evolution is amazing. #Grammys
@TAFKAP91 Doesn't he though? Did he speak? I'm too busy watching the Bruins vs. Sabres game right now to pay any attention to the Grammys.
Miranda Lambert's mic is red, all I can think of Taylor Swift #red #grammy

Rihanna is gorgeous #Grammys
"@AtJackie: Rihanna looks G O R G E O U S! #grammys" stab yourself
Way to be drunk Kelly Clarkson, lol. :) #GRAMMYS
Alicia keys is just amazing #grammys
The only person worth watching the Grammys is Carrie Underwood. ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ #perfect
Kelly Clarkson actually knows Miguel. They get their perms done at the same hair dresser # grammys
There's no way Kelly Clarkson isn't intoxicated. #GrammyAwards
"@MusicalVirgo: Lmao Kelly Clarkson said "Miguel idk who the hell you are but we need to do a song together" haha #Grammys"
But how in the hell do not know Miguel. Leave the Grammy's at this point.
Miranda Lambert and Dierks Bentley performing at the #Grammys! :D sweet! #rep.country#Grammys
Fave Grammy moment? Radiohead and that all boys marching band doing 15 step. Can we go back to that? #grammys
In addition, I concur, Miguel's performance was incredibly sexy. And I also want to sing with him meow. #Grammys
Congrats to Kelly Clarkson on the grammy! (:
What's great about the Grammy's this year?? No Nicki Minaj.  What's good about them??  Absolutely nothing. TV off...bedtime.
Rihanna looks rather classy tonight. #grammys
That awkward moment at the Grammys when Britney Spears sings 'Hit Me Baby One More Time' and everyone looks at Chris Brown.
Quit making comments on Kelly Clarkson's weight. You don't have that right considering she just won a Grammy and you're sitting on the couch
Lana did the Grammys BEFORE the Grammys were Grammys that's where she is
Chris Brown is respectable. #GrammyLive
If I see Chris Brown on stage with @rihanna Im gonna be pissed. #Grammy
America Is really becoming obese when celebrities are getting fat too. #grammys
I love the grammys &amp; all of the eye candy that comes along with it! -cough cough, ADAM LEVINE! â¤
I think Santana sang Girl on Fire better than Alicia Keys on the last episode of Glee #grammys
"@MrAListEnt: Hope the homies Breezy Ocean Trey etc are taking notes Justin Timberlake just took the Grammys to church"
Hahahahahahahah Kelly Clarkaon really said I dont know who the hell you are to miguel hahaa..... But how do you not know him #grammys
5 years ago Rihanna and Chris Brown sat together nd at the Grammys Afterparty. A tragedy happened. Hope it dont happen again this year.
Watching the Grammys before I go to work (@ Taihron's Mom/Grandma's House) http://t.co/Jgm5JlXY
Oh Kelly, you crack me up. #Grammys
@TheGRAMMYs @CodySimpson Cody looks adorable &gt;.&lt; there's NO explanation for him being single c;
Wait, hold up? Did Kelly Clarkson just threw shade on Miguel?? The compliment was cool, but the rest was a low blow. What an idiot #grammys
Clearly you can tell I'm a fan of Rihanna. #Grammy
lets be real people, you want to hump everyone on the Grammys right now except for Elton John
how can u guys be hating on taylor at the grammys when one direction cant even get in #ifoundthisontumblr #sueme
The Black Keys and Mumford &amp; Sons @THEGRAMMYS #best#grammy ever!

#Grammys Kelly Clarkson is wasted and also did to much.
Everyone needs to stop hating on Kelly Clarkson. That bitch just won a GRAMMY while y'all sit on your fat asses tweeting about her #jussayin
â€œ@L1LDebbie: "RT @ActionBronson: I just seen Riff Rafff at the Grammys. #win" he's sittin behind JayZ &amp;amp; Beyonce!  @JODYHiGHROLLERâ€

You go Glynn Coco...i mean @kelly_clarkson you deserve it.....now i can be unbored and watch something else now #TheGrammys, onto #FamilyGuy
LMAO Kelly Clarkson said she didn't know who Miguel was, but wants to do a song with him #Grammys
Is there an instrument or musical equipment that Alicia Keys dont play? #Grammys
"@admireavonkid: I hope Frank wins all his nominations if not Grammys are worthless to me." Rih still has a chance
Thank god Rihanna is her beautiful self again :) #loveher #Grammys
"Miguel, I don't know who the hell you are, but we need to sing together, that thing you did was sexy as hell" ðŸ˜‚ #Grammys #KellyClarkson

"@jazzy0478: Has Kelly lived under a rock to not know who @MiguelUnlimited is?? #Grammys"I've been under the rock with her
frank didn't wear his yellow tux at the Grammys and rock out with his cock out :-(

Kelly clarkson doesn't know who Miguel is but your right he is sexy #GRAMMYS
Probably not many watching the #Grammys remember Artie Shaw or Ella Fitzgerald. Too bad, in my view music from that era was tbe best.
Kelly Clarkson yanked on John Mayer's weird velvet coat and it made me so uncomfortable. #Grammys
Katy Perry. #Grammys
Ed Sheeran seriously deserved the Grammy for song of the year. Best lyricist in that category was him!!!!!!! #SoMad #Grammys
Adam Levine and Alicia keys....wow! #amazing #grammys
Rihanna !! #grammys
Maroon 5 and Alicia Keys. Amazing. I want to cry. #grammys

@IAmJericho @TheGRAMMYs Umm, I think Clarkson has more crossover appeal, but Underwood is the current bigger star.
I feel like Rihanna is about to rip this dress off and have on something else. #Grammys.
Miranda Lambert and Hillary Scott must have the same nutritionist. #Grammys

Chris Brown and Frank Ocean will fight again tonight after the #Grammys
#whitneytributetowhitneyhouston. She deserved it grammys and u know it she did fuck grammys u forget the tribute to Whitney.

I hope Carly Rae has discovered she isn't winning a Grammy. If the biebs can't do it. She can't do it.
My one Grammy's contribution is... - Chris Brown strikes me as the type that tries to "Casually rent out" Rihanna to his friends..
Uh oh, Ne-Yo is threatening to out-sparkle Carlie Rae Jepsen. #Grammys
Wiz is such a classy thug.. #DaddySteez #GetIt #GRAMMYs
@gkowalick See, Rihanna did our song;-) #Grammys

John Obi Miguel #ChelseaGrammyTweet
â€œ@BigBUDDAHMan: #Grammy2013 she was singing about Chris Brown.â€ #Truth !! If Ahe Chooses To Forgove Him So Be It !! #LoveIsLove

Whereâ€™s Justin Bieber. Oh wait this is for talent, not popularity. #Grammys
Well, I don't know who those guys were with Jay-Z but loved the acceptance speech.  #Grammys
Rhianna &amp; Jack White was pretty good but even better would be @1NatalieMaines and Ben Harper. #TheGrammys
Is it me or the perfs this year are quite short? Miss those epic mash-up performances. Hopefully the Bob Marley tribute delivers. #Grammys
A little late but I LOVED JT's performance #hesback #Grammys2013

I cant wait to see the grammys give their tribute to bob marley
Drag show trumps Grammys any day. Duh. @ Friends on Ponce http://t.co/5BnmKo2f
My last tweet about the Grammys. If Bruno mars sings any of bob marleys songs.. I may have to punch him right in the face.
Springsteen has 20 Grammys so I guess I cant be greedy. Glad for the Black Keys though :)
Barbados in the house!!!!! @rihanna @TheGRAMMYs
THE ONLY REASON JAY-Z WENT TO THE GRAMMYS WAS TO DO THE SONG WITH JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE PERIOD!!!
This years Grammys are sponsored by Justin Timberlake.
They cut that Grammys "hurry tf up with your speech" music quick af when Jay-z started talking lol
Sarah just asked "Justin Bieber ain't old enough to go to the Grammys yet?" hahahahahahah

"@DevinScillian: The #Grammys seem more elegant to me tonight -- lots of tuxes and gowns. Nice trend. (Timberlake lit it up.)" Agreed!
Ed sheeran still gets performance of the night. #edisgood #Grammys
Oh so they turn off the "your speech is too long" song when Jay Z speaks ðŸ˜‚ #GrammyAwards
The Grammy should be a steak and underwood should have to eat it.
Soooooo far the BEST PERFORMANCES are ...... Rihanna and Justin Timberlake  #Grammys
as much as I hate Rihanna, the girl did fan-FUCKING-tastic! #grammys
Wait. Justin is performing again. Way to keep me tuned in #Grammys
Thank you to all the Grammy winners for not thanking God or Jesus. Itâ€™s more honest that way. Seriously.
The Grammy orchestra was about to play the cutoff song but Jay-Z walked up to the mic and THEY stopped. #boss #respect
I guess Gaga made the #GRAMMYS more interesting to watch bc this year is boring as fuck...
The Dream told Frank Ocean to "step back" AND THEN went on a rant about how he was cut off in a previous Grammy acceptance speech! # NoShame
Ok who just sang with Rihanna?? Hubs is trying to tell me it was Johnny dep not sure I believe that?? #GRAMMYs #Rihanna
"Imagine how this gon' look front row at the #grammys," exclaimed Hova on his seminal record with Mr. West.  And to the after party.
Justin Timberlake ...mmm #Grammy's
This year's #Grammys has a disturbing lack of Eminem.
Where's Jack White? #GRAMMYs
â€œ@MTV: "I wanna thank The Dream for his  hat." -- Jay-Z #Grammysâ€ But... That... That werent the joke...
So I really could care less about the Grammys. The CMAs and ACMs are all i care about. #sorrynotsorry
Can anyone let me know when the Bob Marley tribute comes on? #Grammys
I can't decide who gives me a bigger lady boner: Beyonce or Rihanna #Grammys

Bob Marley dedication at the Grammys ðŸ‘ðŸ’šâ¤ðŸ’›
It could be argued that the two best #Grammys moments were tributes - Bruno Mars &amp; Sting plus Kelly Clarkson's earlier bit.
The Grammys...also known as Weird Mashups. STING, Rhianna, Bruno Mars..with a tribute to Bob Marley? I cannot get on board with this.
The cameras constantly pointing at Taylor Swift is making me not want to watch the Grammy's. #annoying
Whereâ€™s Lauryn Hill? #Grammys
Is that Global Warming? No that is the Potheads of America group lighting their best for Bob Marley. #Grammys
LoL @ the guilt on Chris Brown's face during RiRi's performance. #GRAMMYs

@getglue IMO, #JackWhite will b the highlight of the #Grammys.
#GRAMMYS .. YUH DUN KNOW .. BOB MARLEY .. NUFF RASPEC
Why @Drake is not in the front row at the Grammy's is beyond me...you wanna put Taylor Swift in front of him? Please.
Mumford and The Sons &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ðŸ™ŒðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ can't wait ! #Grammys
Please ID the thirsty Grammy's producer that panned from Rihanna to Chris Brown to Frank Ocean to Drake. America ain't got time for that.
Drake is sexier than all of you niggas out there #sorrynotsorry #Grammys
Rude as Mumfords bit standing! #gobacktothequeenwiththatish #grammys
Bitches be like, "FUCK CHRIS BROWN! WOMAN BEATER!" and then after the Grammy's be like, "Breezy can get at me, he can beat me, IDC!"

that amazing tribute performance to bob marley made my night #bobmarley #thegrammys #onelove
Rihanna beat out every other live performer tonight at the #Grammys, surprisingly. Too bad she'll be beat by Chris Brown later tonight.
The irony of the cast of breaking Amish and Rihanna on the stage at the same time ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ nice Grammy producers I got that one
I am going to assume the Marley Tribute will be the highlight of the show...unless they show Kelly Rowland again! #grammys

While we reasons to believe Sir Marley's tribute would be stirring, the fervor attributed to Sting and, likewise, Bruno was noble.  #grammys
So. For clarification. If Chris Brown punches you in the face you will win a #grammy? Psychic fists.
Bob Marley tribute was amazng #grammy2013
Chris Brown gotta nose ring?  When did this happen #GrammyAwards
Bob Marley tribute tho! ;) #grammys

Love watching Taylor Swift havin a blast with each performance! #GRAMMYS
This is a hate-tweet about Taylor Swift. #Grammys
The performance I have been waiting for, #TheLumineers (since the Bob Marley tribute wasn't a tribute...) #TheGrammys
Bruno Mars &amp; Sting for Bob Marley tribute. THAT was the #Grammys moment.
Taylor Swift having a ball. #Grammys
Justin Bieber missed the grammys because he is picking up a dub for him and lil twist hes so sorry he couldnt make it
"@bieberdish: Justin Bieber's Scheduled Livestream During Grammy Awards Fails Due toechnical Difficulties http://t.co/zu94jyha" @KaleaSnow
Can we stop cutting to Taylor Swift singing along in the audience? Yay she's a fan of everyone, we get it. #Grammys
I had very little opinion pro or con about Taylor Swift. Until tonight .Now I really hate the chick. #Grammys
When Bruno Mars asked me to marry him - was nervous but now YES! #grammys
Taylor swift sit down, this isn't prom. #Grammys

Taylor Swift appears to know the lyrics to every song being performed tonight. #grammys
Taylor Swift knows the words to every song ever recorded. #thingsthegrammystaughtme

Real husbands of Hollywood in between Grammy commercials lol
Shout out to Jay-Z, he's the only one I have seen with a drink in his hand#Grammys
Taylor swift jams out to every song played on the Grammys.
@llcoolj why has Chris Brown been crying the whole show? Is he upset he lost, or just happy Rihanna is sitting next to him?! #grammy
Drake won for best hiphop album over Nas? That's weak, even for the Grammy Awards, guh.
Diggin the Lumineers right now #Grammys
Is Hunter Hayes country music's Justin Bieber?? #SoccerGrammys
Was expecting more from that tribute to Bob Marley....that was the main reason for staying up...or well! #Grammys
Ok. Taylor swift is the worst. Just the worst person. I want to punch her. #grammys
Mellisa etheridges hair looks like the back of a horses ass. Hunter Hayes needs to sit down. Lumineers are great. #grammys
JACK WHITE #GRAMMYs
And the Grammy for sitting in the audience and singing along (annoyingly Im sure) to everyone else's song goes to Taylor Swift.
"@HuggyLowdownDC: #grammys Bob Marley Tribute! What No Snoop Lion!" Lol!
I think Robert Downey Jr. would have made the Grammys a bit better.
Watching Taylor Swift in the audience at the #Grammys has entirely endeared me to her. What a supportive peer.
What is the deal with keeping Taylor Swift on camera?? #Grammys
HUNTER HAYES IS IN ALL BLACK, TOO. I really never thought he was cute until tonight. #grammys
Taylor Swift is really into The Lumineers. She's rocking out in the aisle. #guncleatthegrammys #GRAMMYs
I love how Taylor Swift is jamming to every performance!!!! #Grammys

LL Cool J is on the Grammys and @therealMalosh says "is that Hines ward?"
If I grow up to be half as happy as Taylor Swift is at the #Grammys tonight, I'll consider my life a success
Alicia and Bruno performed already so yea I'm fine watching the Grammys lol
But all waah gwaan Dem couldnt Do #Grammys without the king of reggae Bob Marley it would jus be utter disrespect still
People mad about the length of the tribute. We don't need 30min set to acknowledge Bob. Truth is any set would be too short... #thegrammys
I just reeeeeaally want to know why they keep showing Taylor Swift in the audience during every performance... STOP #Grammys
I'm so excited that Jack White is on stage right now. #grammys
I might have to turn off the #Grammys if they don't stop cutting to Tswift's awkward dance moves #itmakesmeuncomfortable
I never realized Bruno Mars was a midget.... #Grammys
I wish #ImagineDragons was performing but Jack White is so that's awesome! #GRAMMYS

Is anyone else confused as to why jack white is at the Grammys lol
Love watching Taylor Swift dance and sing in the audience :) #GRAMMYs
I really wanted to see Hunter Hayes win a grammy...
Ugh The Lumineers are so lame for playing music they like ugh Taylor Swift is so lame for being happy and singing songs she enjoys. #Grammys

@michaelneis Canâ€™t help but think the #Grammys could use some Lou Begaâ€¦ #TheTrumpet
Levon Helm &amp; Dave Brubeck tributes? Don't disappoint me, Grammys.
This #Grammys has been very calm, granted last year I made a snatch comment about Lady GaGa and people assaulted my timeline. #CrazyMonsters

â€œI love this songâ€--Prince announcing that Gotye has won the Grammy for â€œSomebody I Used To Knowâ€
Prince	#grammy whoa Prince loves that song " better than a Grammy" #Gotye
I'd be happier to have Prince say he loves my song over actually winning the  Grammy. #grammys
Prince looks so bored #Grammys
Gotye is just as overplayed as Fun, but Somebody That I Used to Know is a better song. #Grammys
if i could receive a grammy from prince, wearing that dress .... id be in heaven
Prince is still cool. #Grammys
@racenight apparently Kimbra came to the Grammys as a fairy?

Man watching TV with hot girls on the Grammys and Buckwild knowing I have no chance whatsoever with them is really depressing.
What is Kimbra wearing? And when did Prince go blind? Such a hot mess on stage right now #Grammys
@CodyRhymer sorry... She's taken by mike fisher. Too bad the Blackhawks beat her husbands team tonight and she was at the Grammys lol
Gotye and Kimbra win! STILL obsessed with that song. #Grammys
10 bucks says prince has a hangover and that's why he has the sunglasses on lol #Grammys
Dude just referred to Prince as "man standing behind us with a cane" I knew there was a reason I never liked this song! #grammys
Does prince age at all?!?!? #soimpressed #Grammys
The only negative thing about not watching the Grammys is missing carrie Underwood..
I'm glad Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, and Lady Gaga were not at the Grammys.
taylor swift at the Grammys is that annoying bitch at a concert that everyone wants to shoot with an AK47.

they should give a grammy to the charlie brown theme song for being the dopest song of ALL TIME!
Taylor Swift is no where beat country. Anyone who thinks she is needs to learn son real country. #Grammys
Realize that the Grammys just used the Bob Marley Tribute to cement and solidify Bruno Mars as the industry's next bonafide ReggaeIslandStar

So far my favorite dress= Rihanna #GrammyAwards
â€œPrince is pleased to announce that the #Grammy for record of the year goes to Gotye and Kimbra for â€œSomebody That I Used To Knowâ€â€

â€œ@_MigoHitMyBoost: Chief Keef , A Grammy ? Nah. *Waves Hand*â€ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Whenever Ryan Seacrest speaks, I have immediate flashbacks to American Idol. #Grammys

Taylor Swift is #AnnoyingAF #Grammys #relaxdude #growthehellup

Ryan Seacrest would be chairman for the Grammys. He's freaking everywhere like herpes
@Tilleyboo22 did you see her with Ryan Seacrest before the grammys?I wasnt sure if she was high or had an extra chromosome!
How did Ryan Seacrest become an honorary chairman? I'm so confused. #grammys
Oh. Grammy Foundation time. Everybody use this opportunity to get a wine refill.WAIT. Justin Timberlake?!

JT needs to get into late night TV once he's old. Too cool not to. #Grammys
Dave Brubeck was a God. So glad he's recognised by the Grammys. Although not for long enough that jazz needed to carry onnnnn
Seacrest is honorary chairman of the Grammy Foundation? Have the #GRAMMYs seen what AI is doing to set music back 100 years this season?
I vote Justin Timberlake to host the #Grammys next year.

I must say that I'm glad that Chris Brown had enough sense to cut &amp; dye his hair back before he came to the Grammy's.
Is Justin Timberlake wearing white socks with his tux?#Grammys
Hey, take a shot every time you catch one of Taylor's many ex boyfriends in the grammy audience. Oops you're dead from alcohol poisoning :(
JT is too cute! #GRAMMYs
#Grammys @TheGRAMMYs Oh please,oh please, oh please, give Justin Timberlake more airtime~ Said no cool person EVER.
JT is awesome, but he should stay with acting and leave music behind #grammys
Ryan Seacrest accidentally hitting Taylor Swift in the face at the Grammys kinda made my entire night.. #Yes

The TV is taller than Ryan Seacrest #Grammys
#Grammys Kelly Clarkson owning it!
No JT, this was not the best Grammys ever becuz there was no Justin Bieber and Frank Ocean didn't win everything
So  Drake won a Grammy this evening, but he won bigger last fall when he earned his high school diploma. #educationmatters. #bestheeverdid
No surprise, Taylor Swift wins cutest outfit of the Grammy Awards.
Great solo performance by the voice of television himself, Ryan Seacrest. *cue music* #Grammys
@WWE Jim Johnson just deserves a #Grammy!
Sooo Chris Brown isn't going to perform. What type if shit is this ?! #grammys
James Fauntleroy would be racking up Grammys as an artist, but he isn't aesthetically pleasing, so he chills behinds the scene.

@Dayton_Mom @thegrammys @EltonJohn @Sandyhook #EltonJohn dedicates his performance to #SandyHook. Got to Love &amp; Respect it.
Taylor opening up the grammys? :/ where u at kanye?
I would reply to that girl but idk her. But Whitney Houston got recognized at the last Grammys because she died right before them.
One more thing, amazing nod to Luis Alberto Spinetta! #Grammys
Oh my God amazing tribute...chills! #Grammys
I have a feeling this isn't the first time Elton John screamed "put the load on me" #grammys
So glad they did "the weight" #Theband that song means so much to me for many reasons. #Grammys RIP Levon Helm
@Leanne_paige I think Katy Perry's boobie won a Grammy!  #kappa
I love that women like Brittany Howard are the up and coming artists of today. Talent over looks. #Grammys
Getting more excited about seeing the Alabama Shakes in a month! #Grammys #theweight
Taylor Swift should have put one of her many exes on that wheel. I vote John Mayer. Love the Alice theme though. #GRAMMYs
@annaholler are you guys watching the Grammys? Taylor Swift just performed
Jack White was freaking dope. #Grammys
Shot out to my father Calton Coffie for receiving his Grammy in 93 for best reggae album @35th ceremony!! #BIGshoes2fill
Literally JUST said that to @EzinneOkpo.. Why lord?! #grammys â€œ@Ky33: Kelly Clarkson's weight fluctuation is so unfortunateâ€
Taylor, why are you making a mess with all that coffetti. It's only the begining of the show! #GRAMMYS
Loved Jay-Z's comment on The Dream's hat #GRAMMY
Alright now Ms. Staples! The song ended 2days ago! Y r u still yelling? #Grammys
RT @JJ_Hairston: Mavis Staples said I will be the last one to squall on this stage!! Lol!! #Grammys
â€œ@LogoTV: Elton John's bedazzler deserves an Emmy. #Grammysâ€
Taylor Swift is cool but when the fk she become a valley girl. Stick to country #GrammyAwards #Grammy
Taylor swift opening the Grammys was not wise. that girl can't perform.
#Grammys what happened to Don Cornelius and Whitney Houston in your memorial tribute...smh
Frank about to close these Grammys with a bang
Justin timberlake ! I did not know he sang this song !!!  #Grammys
Who said Andre 3000 prince and frank ocean having a 3some after the Grammys....
Tuned in grammys for tribute, expecting more for MCA... lame.
@thegrammys Elton John is still the best ever #Grammys
I've seen both Alabama Shakes AND Elton John live. Both shows were amazing. #BragTweet #Tribute #Grammys

Drake's first Grammy "Best Rap Album" nuff said..
I will agree that Kendrick will win multiple Grammy's next year @hughesgene .One thing we can agree on
YES! Prince looked great! RT @songza: Prince says "Somebody That I Used to Know" is record of the year. Prince doesn't lie. #GRAMMYs
Never forget that Bob Dylan didn't even try to show up for this. #Grammys
RT @bubbawatson: I think when we ( Golf Boys ) release our new single we will win a Grammy &amp; be asked to perform next year!! #Grammys
why Did Taylor Swift open up the Grammys? -.-
â€œ@hayy_lewis: Grey's anatomy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grammysâ€ not even a difficult decision
#grammy - also remembering Whitney Houston !!!
#Grammys West Coast! Great start with Taylor Swift!
Thankfully ROH is on so I can turn off the #grammys and enjoy something less fixed. Thank you Sinclair Broadcasting for giving me this out
L.L. Cool J needs to close this out w "Mama said Knock You Out" #Grammys Or as I wanted earlier-just give Prince a guitar and 10 minutes
Mavis Staples just nailed it! #rrrrraspy #thegrammys #classic
God dammit. I love Jack White too. #Grammys
That was an awesome tribute to Levon Helm. #GRAMMYs â˜º
Was Taylor swifts Grammy performance a statement to some public relationship she had that we don't care about
Is it possible for Taylor Swift to be rejected by so many guys? That's all she sings about. it's time for honest discourse on 55th Grammys
Fail. â€œ@HuffPostWomen: Loving this rendition of "Take A Load Off Annie" #Grammysâ€
I wish I was at the GrammysðŸ˜© looking forward to see Maroon 5, Frank Ocean &amp; Bruno Mars perform!P.S. Katy Perry looks HOTTTT!!!ðŸ˜ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥â¤

For anyone watching the #Grammys... What were they thinking when they let that woman sing?? Oh my gosh... Mavis Staples. #lol
Why wasn't Justin on the #Grammys ?

Jack White looks like a young, pale Porter Wagner. #GRAMMYS
Highly recommended: Elton John, Mumford &amp; Sons, Mavis Staples, Zac Brown and Alabama Shakes singer Brittany Howard tribute to Levon #grammys
Taylor Swift doesn't deserve a Grammy, she deserves to be set on fire. :-)
I am convinced Prince is an alien from another galaxy #Grammys
Everyone's like I love Hunter Hayes and I'm just like umm, have y'all seen Dierks Bentley? #Grammys
RT "@NatalieGrant: I would like for Brittany Howard to sing again please. #grammysâ€  Yes Please!!
Good job Grammy's. Hate I missed JT and Alicia Keys/Maroon 5
Oh man, I missed Mavis Staples on the Grammys.
"@Rhettt22: Twitter is fucking gay tonight. Fuck the grammy's who cares"
Gonna see some Betty's sporting FEWDM bracelets now. I've been with this for quite a while. But now it's the new bandwagon. Thanks, Grammys.
Taylor Swift's performance at the Grammy's was just so beautiful I couldn't watch. Or listen. Or not switch the channel.
Justin timberlake ' freaking Sexy , Great voice , and he can Dance ! #grammys
Lmao I caught that too! RT @Irenepaulina11: Taylor Swift definitely just mimicked Harry Styles on the Grammy's in her performance
You can't call it a bob Marley tribute and then put some bullshit Bruno song up there #grammys
That Bob Marley tribute was AWESOME!!!....Thank you #BrunoMars #PhillipLawrence #Sting #Grammy2013
Nothing will ever top Elton John &amp; Eminem's performance of Stan back in 2006! #Classic #TheGrammys
Michael We Miss you!! #GrammyAwards  RT @ParisJackson: awhhh&lt;33
Killing me. | RT @HitFixGregory: Kelly Rowland says no Destiny's Child tour in the works #Grammys http://t.co/VucKB8op via @HitFix
Mavis staples is my new favorite :p #GRAMMYs #Bestdressed
Prince looks like Max from A Goofy Movie. #Grammys
I want to call LL Cool J the Wayne Brady of rap, but from a historical perspective, a rapper hosting the Grammys is dope.
Bruno Mars looks like a lady. #Grammys
Mention Michael Jackson and I instantly start crying #Grammys2013 #westcoast
Justin and Jay killed it #Grammys
Does anyone still consider Taylor Swift a country performer? #Grammys
Go home Mavis, you're drunk. #GrammyAwards #internetmemes
Prince will now take Gotye back to his home, play a quick pickup game of basketball and then make them pancakes. Bitches. #Grammy

Oh Chris Brown, you can never get it right, can ya? #grammys
Sad to say but this is the first time hearing Taylor Swift's song! #grammys
Missed Jack White at the #Grammys. Dammit!
I like Bruno Mars and Sting but someone please explain what this has to do with Bob Marley #Grammys
Levon Helm tribute crushed it!! Second place was the Marley tribute!! #Grammys
Whitney died before last years Grammys that list is everyone who died after last years Grammys.
â€œ@claudiajordan: I love that LL Cool J is hosting the Grammys again!  #Grammysâ€ it appears as if you're the only one.
The Grammys was good... Until they took Taylor Swift off the camera.
Rihanna looks damn fine tho #WhenDoesntShe #WomanCrush #Grammys
Maybe if Frank Ocean or The Weeknd were to win, the Grammys would be worth while to watch
HA.....  RT@JJ_Hairston: Mavis Staples said I will be the last one to squall on this stage!! Lol!! #Grammys"
I almost forgot ab Idol being a legit show! â€œ@corynnecorbett: Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood have really made their  #grammysâ€

"All i see on my Tl is grammy's, walking dead, Rihanna's forehead, Katy Perry's boobs and some hoe talking bout how she needs a valentine.."

Watching The Grammys ..And Uhh...Rihanna Is So BEAUTIFUL..Like Always..â™¥
Juanes at the #Grammys
So apparently the Grammys are on. Whatever, Iâ€™m totally watching Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros on Austin City Limits.
Best part of Taylor's performance was "I'm busy opening the Grammy's" ... Unfortunately she tried but failed at #bringingsexyback #Grammys
Kelly Clarkson looked like she ate the Denny's Grammy stand breakfast....every hour #Grammys
This Bob Marley tribute is pretty much a perfect storm of everything I hate. #Grammys  #Hell
acknowledging victims of Newton at #Grammys, so humbling @eltonjohn! respect.
Juanes!!!!! #Grammys
Love the throwbacks to Michael. Thanks @jtimberlake and the Tennessee kids. #GRAMMYs
JUANES IS ON THE GRAMMYS AND THEY'RE PLAYING A DIOS LE PIDO!!! PATRICK I'M DYING!!!! @patrickk_del

#TheGrammys would be so much better if Justin Bieber was there.. and One Direction. Just saying though.
"With a little luck and a lotta GRACE we all made it here tonight." LL Cool J at the #Grammys Thank God for His Grace.
@brittanypaige13 @MartineCourtney Taylor Swift didn't even belong on the grammys... #AintNobodyGotTimeForThat

Dear Some-Kind-of-Spanish man singing Elton's song - thanks but not thanks #NoEstaNoche #Grammys
Please stop ruining my favorite Elton John song, whoever you are #grammys
Juanes covering Elton John's "Your Song" in English and Spanish sealed the deal. Best #grammys yet.
Juanes, WTF are you doingâ€¦. #Grammys
Yo I'm done with that ho Taylor Swift! Stop panning the Camera on her! Shit #Grammys
Sting joining Bruno Mars on the Grammys is the intimate irony.
Only Sir Elton John can sing Your Song. It's his song for crying out loud. #grammys
JUANEEEESSSS #GRAMMYS &lt;3
JUANES!!! #GrammyAwards
@kelly_clarkson u were absolutely amazing tonight Kelly and looked incredible #Grammys
Juanes covers Elton John's "Your Song"...this is the perfect ending for the #Grammys.
If someone was going to cover "Your Song" it should've been Ewan McGregor.  #grammys
Keyshia Cole, Ciara, and Keri Hilson have all been at least nominated for multiple Grammys before, that counts for something right?
been waiting for this, Elton John &amp; Ed Sheera! #Grammy2013
By far and beyond the best of tonight is Bruno Mars &amp; Sting's tribute to Bob Marley. Ridiculous. #grammys
It's sir Elton John in Mexican! #grammys
So basically y'all don't want Juanes to perform his own songs is what you're saying. #discrimination #Grammys
Hispanic Helen is freaking out about Juanes #grammys

S/O to all the kids who listened to "La Camisa Negra" in Spanish class, well that's Juanes, the singer of that song haha. #Grammys
I think, since Elton is there, he should be allowed to sing his own song. That was awful. #Grammys
Yeah! Sting! "Walkin' On The Moon"! #grammys

#FallingAsleep Elton John #Grammys
"@TastemakerMag: Did I miss Whitney Houston on the tribute of musician who have passed #GRAMMYs" They did a tribute last year though
That Bob Marley tribute at the Grammy's was the best performance of the day love it. #Grammy2013
These #grammys remind me of CNN on election night. Special effects for the sake of special effects sometimes...
Tribute to Bob Marley was by far my favorite performance #Grammys......so far
And now for everyone uncomfortable with homosexuality...Frank Ocean "Forrest Gump". F**k you America lol! #grammy
FRANK OCEAN, REALLY? RUN YOUR ASS HOME. #GRAMMYS #NEWSONG

This Frank Ocean performance is awesome #Grammy. So unusually cool to hear a man singing 'Runnin on my mind boy'
Who is this guy. Why he is singing about Forest Gump. Horribly.  The hell. the grammys keep going downhill.
The moral of the story is that if you get beat up by Chris Brown, you will succeed in the music business..... #Grammys #GoldenFistsChris
Sir Elton's outfit has more personality than Taylor Swift's entire performance. #grammys
Is this a song about Forrest Gump? Or am I as high as Wiz right now? #Grammys

Beyonce how could you come to the Grammy's and not perform!!! #disappointed
Taylor Swift could of done better and she should of sang "Trouble" I'd rather here Carly Rae Jepsen sing "Call Me Maybe". #grammys
Ready for some LL, Chuck D, &amp; Z-Trip #Grammys

Yes. â€œOnly CBSâ€ would give someone as irrelevant as LL Cool J the final number at the Grammys.
I believe Jack White had one of the best, if not the best performance tonight #GrammyAwards
This dude completely stole my thoughts on Mumford and Sons. #Grammys  http://t.co/qY3ugIIU

I'm so glad Taylor Swift's "We Are Never Getting Back Together" didn't win a Grammy. Maybe it will condition her to make good music again.
Taylor swift needs to sing somethin other than never getting back together like everytime she preforms #grammys
Frank Ocean, you're on the #Grammys &amp; decided to sing that song? #no #awful
Okay Mumford and Sons won best album of the year. I can go to sleep happy now. #Grammys

Bigger studs on LL Cool J and Elton John than we've seen on some women. #grammyjewelry
Who cares about the Grammys, Helen Mirren is rocking PINK HAIR at the BAFTAs
I still think it's bullshit Kendrick didn't release his album in time for the Grammys, when Taylor Swift's came out the same day.
#Grammys Although I don't think Taylor Swift can sing, her performance was good. Very creative.
Mumford and Sons just won. Why are they not on stage now saving us from this madness? #Grammys
Good for the 2006 Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett film Babel winning the 2013 #Grammys Album of the Year. About time.

Things I learned from the Grammys I need to listen to Frank Ocean and Mumford and Sons also need to figure out who Miguel is
So I was wondering how Jay and Kanye won a Grammy... Didn't they win a Grammy for a song on that same album last year????
best part of the #grammys : Bruno mars/sting collabo. worst part: Taylor swift dancing and singing like a moron.
The only reason I watched the Grammy's was to see Frank Ocean's performance.. Now I can go to bed #yay
#GrammyMemories 2001. when everyone called Eminem a homophobe and yet he preformed Stan with Elton John. then flipped off the crowd. #Slim

Ed Sheraan should've won song of the year with A Team. #grammys #amazingsinger

Katy Perry wins the Grammy for the best Tits!
And now the man I've been waiting all night for - LL Cool J performing on stage. I swear the man hasn't aged at all! #grammys

I'm less than okay with LL Cool J being the last performance on the Grammys when there is that much talent in the building.
Best part of LL Cool J's performance is Travis Barker! #Grammys
Do you think Nicole Kidman just asked Keith Urban why he doesn't sound as AWESOME as Jack White? #GRAMMYSCO
Oh no. LL Cool J is rapping. #Grammys
LL, Chuck D and Tom Morelloâ€¦Grammys have come a long way.

I don't even know what's the buzz abt Frank ocean. I dont think i have heard him on the radio and that #grammys performnce was TERRIBLE
â€œ@RobertVSRobert Why is Keyshia Cole so angry at the world ?â€ because she never won a Grammy
Only watching this performance for Travis Barker. #grammys
Hunter Hayes is such a cutie! #Grammys
Too soon, but totally how I feel. RT @j_rossman: Mr. President please end these #Grammys with a drone strike
Quick question, did LL's Grammy contract include a performance or did he say naw i'll throw that in for free
We wanna see the real faces of music at the Grammys...afrojack tiesto aoki Swedish house dada Calvin Harris alesso! Come on!! @abbystrauss

@bomani_jones Mumfords said something that required a 7 second delay.  #livetv #GRAMMYS
Rihanna is really classic and lovely in 100 carat diamond serpent bracelet, $2mm worth of Neil Lane #grammyjewelry
LL Cool J is very fit. #ThatsAll #Grammys #NoCommentOtherwise
I'm too hype right now I got home and my mom was like Erica you'll like the Grammys cause Rihanna was in it saying she did real good :)
Travis, baba #Grammys
Performance #sucked "RT @HuffingtonPost: Frank Ocean ends the #Grammys with two awards, one performance http://t.co/ZerR1w1j"
Only good thing about this is Travis barkers drumming. LL is going to be sad when he goes back to twitter. #Grammys
I'm sorry Frank Ocean.  Knock it off. #terrible #whatwasthat #forestgump? #stop #grammys
RLRT @cli6cli6 "LL Cool J told em, 'I will host the Grammys if you remind people I'm relevant."
Travis Barker is so tight and Tom Morello is just so creative. #Grammys
@kelly_clarkson  Singing "Natural Woman" on AI, and then Grammys brings it full circle!!! AWESOME!!
Glad to see LL Cool J survived the Deep Blue Sea and cooked his way into a performance with the world's most overrated drummer. #Grammys
Who is the better guitar player Tom morello or jack white #Grammy2013  #Grammys
@TheGRAMMYs I thought Taylor Swift gave an excellent performance of the opening of the show. #Grammys @taylorswift13
What's this about Chuck D on the Grammy Awards? I finally boarded a flight home and am missing the... entertainment?
Adam Lavine and Alicia Keys ðŸ˜ #Grammys
"@Z1079: 2013 Grammy Award Performances [VIDEOS] http://t.co/uhRL9baM #fb" @wizkhalifa was awesome and looked great
â€œ@_Chelsea_Smirk: The Grammys recognised Mitch Lucker. Feels right now, someone hug me with feels so I'm not aloneâ€
The grammys said no side boob. But I just a lot of katie Perry's inner boob.
I already know Mr. G is watching the #Grammys. He's gonna love the Bob Marley tribute. ðŸ˜Š
Could the #grammys get any better? John mayer!
NO SLEEP TILL BROOKLYN #Grammys
RT: @TheFlanchise: Garth Brooks - Callin Baton Rouge http://t.co/GAnsPs4z. Good music to offset the garbage that is on the Grammys.
I love no one more then I love John Mayer #Grammy2013 #Grammys #johnmayer â¤â¤â¤â¤
For those dissing Frank Ocean, listen to the record. Best R&amp;B Iâ€™ve heard in years. Tonight, he was just trying something out. #Grammys
Tom Morello, Travis Barker, LL and Chuck D going down now!  #Grammys
What a ending to the #grammys. @llcoolj @travisbarker, Tom &amp; ZTrip
Wait...We're missing Tom and Mark. #grammys
L.L.Cool J, Chuck D., Tom Morello, and Travis Barker tearing that shit up! #Grammys
Chuck D , Tom morello and ll cool j.....omg #grammys
I wonder what's going thru Jay-Z 's mind during LLCoolJ's performance.... #grammys
No Sleep Til Brooklyn! #Grammys
Tyler is singing along to the Grammys and its adorable
Seriously pissed Drake didn't get awarded his Grammy onstage.. ðŸ˜¡
I guess a Bullet in the Head/By the Time I Get to Arizona medley was too much to ask. #GRAMMYs
K why isn't Justin bieber at the Grammys? Just wondering....
Oh Shizz, it's TOM MORELLO! #Grammys
Omg i can't handle all these awful tweets about Adele and fun. #iloveyou #Grammys
#Grammys metal sightings: Tom Morello on guitar of finale w/ LL Cool J and Chuck D; Extreme's Nuno Bettencourt on guitar in @rihanna's band.
The lead singer of Fun looks like the love hold of Matt Damon &amp; Henry Rollins. #Grammys
LL Cool J is rocking on the #grammys.  Loving the new song.  #superfan
Kendrick should be at the Grammys
Seriously, #Grammys. Chuck D was just a half time show for the Cleveland Cavaliers. So that puts him on the level to close the #Grammys?!
Keyshia Cole Still Aint Learned Exactly Why That Ass Is Watching The Grammys From The Living Room Couch.!
Tom Morello is one of the best guitar players of all time....hands down!! #Grammys
After a seriously underwhelming #Grammys, my suspicions that I'm now blacker than LL Cool J are 100% confirmed.
What's up with the rain on the instruments during #FUN? I'd have to believe that Gibson acoustic is now ruined... #grammys
â€œ@annapettit: For the sake of music... Don't ever end the Grammys with LL Cool J... Ever...... Again.â€PREACH!
Etta James also passed before last years Grammys and no one is mad she wasn't on the slide. #YallIgnoreMeImJustTryingToProveAPoint
Taylor Swift's subtle dig at Harry Styles during her opening performance was so awesome!! "I still love you..." in British accent!! #GRAMMYs
Wait. Who's the guy rapping with LL Cool J? #knowsnothingaboutrap #grammys #NCISLosAngeles
Way to ruin it Delta!! #Grammys
My TL : grammys, Rihanna, Adele, fun, ll cool j, and some random nigga like "heres a big FUCK YOU to everybody that lied to me" lol
I wonder if @add32 and holly are raging to no sleep til Brooklyn like we did in high school? #rockband #Grammys
The Grammys are showing commercials during LL Cool J's performance. Even they know it's trash.
RT â€œ@prestonjones: I like to think Adam Yauch is somewhere throwing up pretty hard right about now. #grammysâ€
"@TheGRAMMYs: Who else is loving Frank's performance effects RT #GRAMMYs" nobody.
Travis Barker #TURNUP #FullSailGrammys #GRAMMYs #KickItToOverdrive
This set with Tom Morello and Travis Barker at the Grammy was preety sweet, especially that tribute to MCA in the middle.
There's a 100% chance Kanye West is making all of these commercials happen during LL Cool J's performance. #Grammys
Skrillex brings home 3 Grammys: Even though 2012 wasnâ€™t necessarily a â€˜hugeâ€™ year for Sonny Moore, aka Skrillex, he... http://t.co/vsEDMQS3
Travis Barker drumming on the Grammys right now? I don't feel as bad watching this now
LL Cool J emptied that Staples Center crowd out with the quickness #Grammys
Watch out LL COOL J is going old school....at the GRAMMY'S!!!!
Kendrick shoulda at least been nominate for a grammy smh
Why is John Mayer wearing Willie Wonka's suit to the Grammys?
One of the greatest music legends to have ever lived...and all you can do is Rihanna, Bruno Mars and Sting? C'mon Grammys!
Quit interrupting LL Cool J's performance. Dang slaps. #Grammy2013
LL Cool J is killin it! Lovin the Beastie Boys tribute. #Grammy's
Tom Morello straight doin work #Grammys
Who the hell is responsible for LL Cool J closing the GRAMMYs?  This is worse than Lil Wayne's rock album.
Justin Timberlake!!!!! #GRAMMYS (@ Hollywood Palladium for Justin Timberlake w/ 46 others) [pic]: http://t.co/3nuY3Sj9
â€œ@KattWiIlliams: Frank ocean made the song Forrest Gump cause he was running from the dick. #Grammysâ€
â€œ@PeytonsHead: #Grammys Katy Perry's boobs have finally arrived. Kay Perry will arrive in 2 minutes.â€ @SarahHerbster
Congratulations to bro Billy Dorsey (and Lecrae) on the GRAMMY for Best Gospel Album: Gravity by Lecrae Label: Reach Records
Um... Hunter Hayes should've won Best New Artist!! #comeon #heISthebest #Grammys
Throw it down Travis Barker. Throw. It. Down! #stillgotit #Grammys
Eminem, Lil' Wayne, Drake and Travis Barker's Grammy finale a couple years ago&gt;&gt;&gt; you seriously will never top that. Ever.
FUCK THE REST OF THE GRAMMYS. BRING BACK KATY PERRY FOR AN ENCORE!!!
Yea! "RT @mamacadabra: MCA forever is right! #Grammys"
Overall this has been quite possibly the WORST #Grammys of all time. Dear lord that was 80% awful. Especially fucking Frank Ocean
Am I the only person in the world who is always underwhelmed by Justin timberlake's music? Anyone...? #Grammys #watchingondelay #unimpressed
No Sleep Till Brooklyn on the Grammy finale.....that was almost as "hot" as Katy Perry. #BeastieBoys @BrianBeckner @DolamiteD @callahan_9
Levon Helm tribute was the best... Way to go Brittany Howard #Grammys
Delta... The power outage of the #Grammys.
Tom Morello if you hate America so much, get the hell out, peddle your mediocre guitar shit in Indonesia for all I care. He closes #Grammys
The #GRAMMYS were great tonight because Mumford &amp; Sons and Gotye won against big name artists! #overjoyed
Do ladies still love cool James &amp; his compulsive lip licking? #Grammys
Best performance of the night = Jack White. Hands down. #grammys
Frank ocean miley cyrus  and mayday parade should've ended the Grammys ðŸ‘Š
Llcoolj was awesome #Grammys #LL #StillBringinIt
Identity Thief is #1 at box ofc n Adele is already beginning her #Grammys win. It's our time. #BigGirlsRock
Is Fine AF	My TL:Females: Frank Ocean Is Fine AF.Males: Adele So Sexy.#Grammys
In the words of the great Brent Mussberger in regards to Katy Perry, "wow what a beautiful woman!" #Grammys #Hottie #shesagem
Lmao Kelly's hella nervous! #Grammys
Really? Fun. I would think The Lumineers deserved that.. But okay. #thegrammys
LL Cool J took us back old school jam #grammys
Go home, Tom Morello, you're drunk. That's not how to play a guitar. #grammys
People stay hating on Frank Ocean but who's the one performing at the Grammy's? Not you bitch.
The grammys is basically all the girls john mayer has fucked î’
The best part of the #grammys hands down was Justin Timberlake !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I rather see Flava Flav...#Grammys #Granndpas
Chuck D with the Pirates cap!! #Grammys #Buccos
